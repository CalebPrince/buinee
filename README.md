# Buinee

A multi-tenant workspace for finance/back-office teams: prepare a payment
voucher from an invoice, get it approved, issue the letter — with real
roles, a real approval trail, and a signature recorded in the system rather
than printed and scanned.

This is the product pivot from two earlier bespoke, single-client builds —
see [Where this came from](#where-this-came-from) below. Nothing here talks
to those projects; it's a fresh codebase that reuses their proven logic
(`voucher.py`, `providers.py`) and lessons.

**Status as of 2026-07-21: landing page + full auth (register/join/approve/
login) are built and browser-tested. The voucher preparation and approval
loop (manual entry, not AI extraction yet) is built and browser-tested —
see [Vouchers](#vouchers) below. Invoice upload/AI extraction and the
payment letter are still not built.**

---

## Running it

```
python server.py     ->  http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

No extra install beyond what's already on the machine — stdlib `http.server`
and `sqlite3`, plus `openpyxl` (FX workbook) and an LLM SDK (`anthropic`/
`google-generativeai`) only if you want the landing page's demo agent live.
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add one API key to enable it; the site
works without it, the demo box just says it isn't configured.

The database is a single SQLite file at `storage/ledgerline.db`, created
automatically on first run. Gitignored. Delete it to reset all companies/
users and start clean.

A `.claude/launch.json` is set up so `preview_start` (name: `ledgerline`)
runs `python server.py` on port 8080.

---

## Deployment — two transports, one route table

`server.py` splits into a transport-agnostic `RouteHandlerMixin` (every
route lives here, and it never touches a socket — it just sets
`self._status`/`self._resp_headers`/`self._resp_body`) plus two thin
transports that read those attributes afterward:

- **`Handler(RouteHandlerMixin, BaseHTTPRequestHandler)`** — a real
  `ThreadingHTTPServer`, used only by `python server.py` for local dev.
- **`application(environ, start_response)`** — a WSGI callable, used by
  `passenger_wsgi.py` under cPanel's Python Selector (Phusion Passenger).
  `WSGIRequest` fakes just enough of `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`'s interface
  (`self.path`, `self.headers.get(name)`, `self.rfile`, `self.client_address`)
  for the exact same route code to run unmodified under either transport.

Both were verified independently: the socket transport via the usual
browser flow (login, dashboard, Command Center all still work after the
refactor); the WSGI transport via `wsgiref.simple_server` serving
`server.application` directly on a throwaway port and hitting it with curl
— GET/HEAD/404s, a full login with cookie-jar persistence, `/api/me`
correctly 401ing with no cookie, and the admin/company endpoints all
checked, with zero code differences from what Passenger will actually run.

**Currently deployed on Render** (`https://ledgerline-qzx5.onrender.com`,
free tier, manual deploys only, socket transport via `python server.py`) —
being moved off Render specifically to stop paying for two hosts (Render
would need the same real cost, monthly, that Namecheap's already-paid
Stellar Plus plan makes free) once the cPanel/Passenger path below is live.

**Moving to Namecheap Stellar Plus** (or any cPanel host with CloudLinux's
Python Selector — check for a "Setup Python App" tool under cPanel's
Software section before assuming this applies):

1. cPanel → Setup Python App → Create Application. Pick the app root (where
   the code lives on the account), the Python version, and the
   domain/subdomain/path it answers on.
2. Get the code onto the server — cPanel's Git Version Control feature if
   available (pulls straight from
   [github.com/CalebPrince/ledgerline](https://github.com/CalebPrince/ledgerline)),
   otherwise File Manager/FTP.
3. Install `openpyxl` into the app's virtualenv — the Python Selector page
   gives you the exact pip command once the app exists.
4. Make sure `passenger_wsgi.py` is at the app root and exposes
   `application` — it already does; nothing to edit unless the app root
   differs from this repo's layout.
5. Storage: `storage/ledgerline.db` lives on the hosting account's normal,
   permanent disk — not a container that gets torn down on deploy, so the
   Render ephemeral-filesystem problem (the whole reason a Persistent Disk
   upgrade was being considered) doesn't exist here at all, at no extra
   cost past the plan you already pay for.
6. Point the actual domain at this app directly in cPanel — no separate
   Namecheap-DNS-pointed-at-Render dance needed once everything's on one
   host.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Public landing page, with a rate-limited public demo agent |
| `register.html` | Register a new company, or request to join one that exists |
| `login.html` | Sign in |
| `dashboard.html` | Post-login workspace — sidebar app shell, role-scoped views, see below |
| `admin.html` | Command Center: Overview — platform stat tiles, the 5 newest signups, system status |
| `admin-companies.html` | Command Center: Companies — every company in full, Finance Supervisor + complete team/pending |
| `admin-login.html` | Platform owner sign in — separate identity from company login, see below |
| `admin-settings.html` | Command Center: Settings — change the platform owner's own password |
| `server.py` | Everything: static pages, the demo agent, and all `/api/*` auth routes — routing logic is transport-agnostic, see Deployment above |
| `passenger_wsgi.py` | WSGI entry point for cPanel's Python Selector — not used by local dev |
| `requirements.txt` | Just `openpyxl` — everything else is stdlib or raw `urllib` (`providers.py`) |
| `db.py` | SQLite schema + all auth logic (passwords, sessions, approvals) |
| `providers.py` | LLM calls (Anthropic / Google / OpenRouter), shared with the demo agent |
| `voucher.py` | Deterministic voucher math — NHIL/GETFL, VAT, WHT, BOG FX lookup. AI reads an invoice; this computes the voucher. Verified against a real BDDG voucher in its own self-test (`python voucher.py`) |
| `bog-fx-rates.xlsx` | Sample Bank of Ghana FX rates workbook, read by `voucher.py`/the demo |

`login.html` and `register.html` share a two-column layout: a fixed-palette
dark brand panel on the left (a small team/approval-trail mockup using
fictional sample people — A. Boateng, S. Owusu, K. Asante — reused from the
landing page's own sample voucher), the actual form on the right. Collapses
to a single column under 900px, hiding the mockup.

**All landing-page sample data is fictional.** Earlier drafts used Rufus's
real BDDG invoice numbers — that's been scrubbed from anything public.
`voucher.py`'s self-test still uses the real reconciled figures deliberately,
as a correctness check; it's never served over HTTP.

---

## Auth model

Three roles, visibility running downward only:

- **Finance Supervisor** — oversees the company. Sees everyone's work.
  Approves join requests.
- **Senior Accountant** — approves and signs vouchers. Sees their own work
  and account assistants' work.
- **Account Assistant** — prepares vouchers and letters. Sees only their own.

**Registering** a company asks the registrant their *actual* role — Finance
Supervisor is not assumed just because they're the one filling in the form.
A junior person can register the company on the boss's behalf and pick their
own real (lower) role; whatever they pick, that account is approved
immediately, since there's nobody else at a brand-new company who could
approve it (`db.register_company`, all three roles allowed).

**Joining** an existing company is always by typing its name
(`db.find_companies_by_name`, a loose `LIKE` search — no email-domain
matching). This is a deliberate decision, made explicitly with the project
owner: *company name alone is public knowledge and is never sufficient to
grant access.* Every join request lands as `status='pending'` and cannot log
in (`db.authenticate` raises `AuthError` for pending accounts) until a
Finance Supervisor at that specific company approves it from their
dashboard — **with one bootstrap exception**: claiming Finance Supervisor
when the company doesn't have one yet (`db.has_approved_supervisor`) is
approved immediately too, same reasoning as registration — there'd be no one
to approve it either way. The moment a company has an approved supervisor,
that exception closes for everyone else: `request_to_join` rejects further
Finance Supervisor claims for that company from then on. (Known gap: this
check-then-insert isn't wrapped in a transaction/lock, so two people
claiming the role for the same still-supervisor-less company at the exact
same instant could theoretically both get approved — a real risk only in
the narrow window between registration and the real supervisor showing up,
not worth engineering around yet at this scale.)

Every other approval/rejection/list-pending query is scoped server-side by
the *session's own* `company_id` — never a client-supplied one — so a
supervisor at Company A cannot see or act on Company B's queue even by
guessing a user id. This was verified directly (registered two companies,
confirmed cross-company approve attempts get rejected).

Passwords: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, stdlib `hashlib`, no bcrypt dependency —
consistent with the rest of this project's no-extra-dependency approach.
Sessions: random token in its own `sessions` table (not a JWT), so they can
be revoked without touching the password. Cookie is `HttpOnly`,
`SameSite=Lax`; no `Secure` flag yet because there's no HTTPS locally — **add
that before this is ever deployed over the open internet.**

---

## Command Center (`admin.html`) — the platform owner's view

Everything above is scoped to one company. The Command Center is the one
place in Buinee that isn't — it's a cross-company view for whoever
actually runs Buinee itself.

**A completely separate identity, not a layer on top of a company account.**
Earlier this was an email allowlist checked against an ordinary company
user; that's been retired. It's now its own table, `platform_admins`
(name, email, password hash+salt), with its own sessions
(`admin_sessions`), its own cookie (`ledgerline_admin_session`, distinct
from the company `ledgerline_session` cookie), and its own login page,
`admin-login.html` — separate from `login.html` both in URL and in look
(fixed dark/violet theme, doesn't follow the site's light/dark toggle,
deliberately reads as "a different system"). A platform admin doesn't need
a company account at all, and a company account confers zero platform
access no matter its role — verified directly: a Finance Supervisor logged
into their own company (Rufus, via `ledgerline_session`) gets a 401 from
`/api/admin/overview`, and having a separate valid `ledgerline_admin_session`
cookie in the same browser continues working independently of whatever the
company cookie is doing — the two never interact.

**There is no HTTP route that creates a `platform_admins` row, on purpose.**
There are two ways to create one, both offline/startup-only, never over
the network:

- **Shell access** (local dev, or any host with a shell/SSH tab):
  ```
  python -c "
  import secrets, db
  db.init_db()
  password = secrets.token_urlsafe(12)
  db.create_platform_admin('Your Name', 'you@example.com', password)
  print(password)
  "
  ```
- **No shell access** (e.g. Render's free tier, which doesn't offer one):
  `server.maybe_bootstrap_admin()` runs once at process startup. Set
  `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (and optionally
  `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_NAME`) as environment variables and redeploy/restart the
  service. It's a no-op the instant `db.count_platform_admins() > 0` — so
  it only ever fires once, and it's safe to leave the env vars in place
  afterward (verified directly: calling it twice in a row with the vars
  still set only creates the account the first time). Worth removing
  `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` afterward anyway, just so a real password
  isn't sitting in a dashboard longer than it needs to.

The Command Center is a persistent left sidebar (Overview, Companies,
Settings, then Toggle theme / Sign out) shared identically across
`admin.html`, `admin-companies.html` and `admin-settings.html`, collapsing
to an icon-only rail under 640px. All three pages call the same single
`/api/admin/overview` (`db.list_companies_with_stats`, `db.platform_stats`)
— there's deliberately no separate per-company detail endpoint; that data
was already in the one response, so a second route would just be dead
weight in a security-sensitive area of the code.

- **Overview** (`admin.html`) — the four stat tiles (companies, approved/
  pending users platform-wide, supervisor count), the 5 most-recently
  registered companies as compact cards in a grid (name, date, Finance
  Supervisor or "no Finance Supervisor yet", approved/pending counts —
  several fit per row, more wrap to new rows as companies are added), and
  the system panel (is the demo agent configured, are FX rates loaded, the
  sqlite path). A "View all companies" link goes to the full list.
- **Companies** (`admin-companies.html`) — every company, newest first, as
  the same kind of compact grid card. Click one (or Enter/Space — it's a
  real `role="button"`) to expand it in place: it spans the full grid width
  and reveals the Finance Supervisor's email plus the complete team and
  pending list. Click again to collapse. Nothing is truncated once
  expanded; collapsed cards stay small so many companies fit on screen.
  Expanded, there's also a **Delete company** button (`db.delete_company`,
  `/api/admin/company/delete`) — permanently removes the company and every
  user in it (and their sessions), with a native confirm dialog first.
  There's no undo and no soft-delete. The confirm message and the button's
  click handler both look the company's name up from the already-fetched
  list rather than round-tripping it through an HTML attribute — an
  earlier version embedded the name directly in `onclick="..."`, which
  silently broke (truncated the whole handler, no error, no console
  warning) the moment a company name contained a literal `"`, since the
  attribute's own quoting collided with `JSON.stringify`'s. Caught by
  deliberately testing a delete against a company named
  `ZZTEST Delete Me Again "Ltd"`.

`admin-settings.html` lets the signed-in admin change their own password
(`/api/admin/change-password`, requires the current password — verified
directly: wrong current password is rejected, correct one changes it, and
the old password stops working immediately after).

`index.html`'s footer has a quiet "Owner sign in" link to
`admin-login.html` — the only place it's surfaced publicly. Nothing in
`dashboard.html` references the Command Center at all anymore; the two
are fully separate front doors.

---

## `dashboard.html`'s app shell

Rebuilt to match the sidebar-rail + topbar layout used across the other
Prince Caleb agent dashboards (`outlook-agent`/`excel-agent`'s
Clerk/Gridwise consoles) — same skeleton, Buinee's own teal/ochre
tokens instead of their slate/amber or emerald/iris ones. Three views,
switched client-side with no page reload:

- **Overview** — greeting, KPI tiles, and card(s) for "My vouchers" (and
  "Awaiting your approval" for Senior Accountant/Finance Supervisor). Every
  number shown is real, drawn from `/api/vouchers`, never an invented demo
  stat — the reference dashboards are sales prototypes and use fabricated
  activity/metrics; this is a real product, so nothing here is illustrative.
- **Vouchers** — prepare, submit, approve/reject. See
  [Vouchers](#vouchers) below.
- **Team** (Finance Supervisor only, nav item hidden otherwise) — the full
  roster and the real pending-approval queue with working Approve/Reject,
  moved off Overview into its own page. The nav item carries a live count
  badge for pending requests, hidden entirely at zero.

Caught one bug while verifying the KPI tiles: the original draft tried to
update a `#kpiTeam` span's `textContent` from inside `loadTeam()` before
that span had even been inserted into the DOM (the KPI HTML was built
afterward), so the team-member count silently stayed blank. Fixed by
having `loadTeam`/`loadPending` both return their counts directly, used to
build the KPI list up front — verified live (logged in as Rufus: "Team
members" correctly showed 2, approving a pending request correctly moved
them into the roster and cleared the nav badge; logged in as Doreen, an
Account Assistant: Team nav item and its KPIs correctly don't appear).

---

## Pricing tiers

Three decisions were made explicitly with the project owner before building
this: **Paystack** as the eventual payment processor (not wired up yet -
see below), a **free tier that unlocks more users on paid plans** rather
than a hard paywall at registration, and **demo pricing** to be replaced
with real numbers later.

**`plans`** (`db.py`): `name`, `price`, `currency`, `user_limit`,
`sort_order`, `is_default`. Seeded once, on first `init_db()`, with:

| Plan | Price | Users included |
|---|---|---|
| Free (default) | GHS 0 | 3 |
| Starter | GHS 50/mo | 10 |
| Growth | GHS 150/mo | 30 |

These are placeholders, not real prices — `admin-plans.html` (Command
Center → Plans) exists specifically so they can be edited, or new tiers
added, without touching code. Every company gets `plan_id` pointing at
whichever plan was `is_default` at the moment they registered (existing
companies were backfilled to it via an idempotent migration in `init_db()`
— `ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN plan_id` only runs if the column isn't
already there, then any `NULL` plan_id gets set to the default).

**Enforcement** (`db.can_add_user`, count of `status='approved'` users
against the company's plan `user_limit`) sits at both places a user can
become approved: `db.approve_user` (the normal path — a Finance Supervisor
approving a pending request) and the bootstrap-supervisor branch of
`db.request_to_join` (claiming Finance Supervisor when a company has none
yet). Both raise a plain-English `AuthError` rather than a generic
rejection. **Downgrading never removes anyone already in** — the check is
only ever "can one more be *added*," so a company that's over its new,
lower limit just can't grow further until it upgrades or someone leaves;
nobody gets auto-kicked. Verified directly, including this exact edge
case: raised BDDG's plan limit to approve someone, then reverted it,
leaving the company one user over its own Free-tier cap — confirmed
`can_add_user` correctly blocks further approvals in that state without
touching the existing (over-limit) team.

Where this is surfaced:
- **`admin-plans.html`** — the only place plans get created or edited
  (`/api/admin/plans`, `/api/admin/plans/create`, `/api/admin/plans/update`,
  all platform-admin only). Inline edit per card, plus an "add a new tier"
  form. A banner states plainly that the prices are demo values.
- **`admin-companies.html`** — each company's card shows its plan name and
  `used/limit`, with an "— at limit" note once it's reached.
- **`admin.html` Overview** — the condensed recent-signups cards show
  `used/limit` in place of a bare count.
- **`dashboard.html` Team view** — a Finance Supervisor sees a plan banner
  above their team/pending panels (`renderPlanBanner`), which switches to a
  warning style once at the limit. The Approve button now surfaces the
  limit error via a plain alert instead of failing silently, since hitting
  the cap is an expected, recoverable state now, not an edge case to hide.
- **`admin-companies.html`**, expanded card — a "Change plan" dropdown
  (every existing plan, current one pre-selected) plus a Move button, wired
  to `db.set_company_plan` / `/api/admin/company/set-plan`. Same
  never-removes-anyone rule as everywhere else: moving a company onto a
  plan smaller than its current headcount doesn't kick anyone out, it just
  means no further approvals until it's back under the new limit or
  upgraded again. Verified directly: moved BDDG (4 users) from Free (limit
  3, so it was sitting over-limit) to Starter (limit 10) — the "at limit"
  warning disappeared immediately and the dropdown correctly pre-selected
  Starter on reload; moved it back to Free and the over-limit warning came
  right back, all without touching any of the 4 existing users. A company
  cannot change its own plan — this is Command Center-only, same as
  creating/editing the tiers themselves.

**Not built**: any actual Paystack integration — no checkout flow, no
webhooks, no subscription lifecycle (trial, renewal, failed payment,
cancellation). The tier/limit machinery and the Command Center's ability to
move a company between tiers are both real and working; what's missing is
the part where a company would actually pay to get moved there themselves.

---

## Vouchers

The prepare → submit → approve/reject loop, wired into `dashboard.html`'s
Vouchers view. Data entry is manual (typed by a preparer) — AI invoice
extraction is not built; see [What's genuinely missing](#whats-genuinely-missing-dont-assume-it-exists).

**`vouchers`** (`db.py`): everything a preparer types (supplier, invoice
number/dates, credit terms, line items as JSON, vatable amount, NHIL/VAT/
VRPO flags, non-taxable/overpayment deductions) plus `status` (`draft` →
`submitted` → `approved`/`rejected`), `created_by`, `approved_by`,
`rejection_reason`. It never stores a computed figure — `server.py`'s
`compute_voucher()` runs every voucher's raw inputs through `voucher.py`'s
`compute()`/`review()` fresh on every read, the same principle as the
landing page's demo (the model/preparer supplies inputs, code does the
arithmetic). This means a future tax-rate change re-derives every existing
voucher instead of leaving stale numbers behind.

**Visibility** (`db.list_vouchers`) follows the same downward-only rule as
everywhere else in this app: an Account Assistant sees only their own
vouchers, a Senior Accountant sees their own plus every Account Assistant's,
a Finance Supervisor sees the company's entire voucher book.

**Segregation of duties**: `db.approve_voucher`/`reject_voucher` refuse if
the reviewer is also the preparer (`created_by == approver_id`), regardless
of role — a Senior Accountant or Finance Supervisor can prepare a voucher
like anyone else, but can't be the one to sign off on their own. Only a
`submitted` voucher can be approved/rejected; only the preparer can submit
their own `draft` or `rejected` voucher (rejecting clears the reason and
puts it back in the queue on resubmission). Role gating (Senior Accountant/
Finance Supervisor only) for the review endpoint lives in `server.py`,
consistent with how `/api/company/approve` gates Finance Supervisor.

Verified end to end in the browser: created a voucher reproducing the real
BDDG sample invoice through the actual creation form — every computed
figure (NHIL 89.23, VAT 267.69, WHT 133.84, net payable 12,477.11, BOG FX
conversion) matched `voucher.py`'s own self-test exactly. Then: submit →
approve as a different Senior Accountant (succeeds); a second voucher
submit → reject with a reason → preparer sees the reason → resubmit clears
it; a Senior Accountant's own submitted voucher correctly refused
self-approval (400) but was approved fine by the Finance Supervisor;
an Account Assistant calling the review endpoint directly got a 403; each
role's visible voucher list matched the downward-only rule exactly.

**Not built**: invoice upload, AI extraction into the form fields, the
payment letter, editing/deleting a voucher.

---

## What's genuinely missing (don't assume it exists)

- **Invoice upload and AI extraction.** The prepare/submit/approve/reject
  loop is built (see [Vouchers](#vouchers)), but every voucher is typed by
  hand — nothing reads an invoice file and fills the form yet.
- The payment **letter** itself doesn't exist — a voucher can be approved,
  but nothing generates the letter that would actually go out (the invoice
  → voucher → letter chain's last step). The template was never sent,
  still needed from Rufus.
- No password reset, no email verification, no "edit a teammate's role"
  UI, no removing/deactivating a user. The platform admin can change their
  *own* password in `admin-settings.html`, but if it's lost entirely the
  only recovery is the same direct-database-script route used to create
  the account in the first place.
- No per-company settings (tax regime, currency, letterhead) — everything
  currently hardcodes Ghana's rates (5% NHIL/GETFL, 15% VAT, 7.5% WHT) in
  `voucher.py`. A non-Ghana tenant needs this to be config, not code.
- The chat/file-sharing feature described in the landing page copy
  ("Send a file to a colleague. Or to an agent.") doesn't exist anywhere
  yet — it's landing-page aspiration, not a built feature.
- Rate limiting on `/api/register`, `/api/join`, `/api/login` is a basic
  per-IP sliding window (20 attempts / 10 min) shared with the demo agent's
  limiter — adequate for now, not hardened brute-force protection.

---

## Where this came from

Buinee replaces two earlier single-client, single-tenant builds at
`D:/Websites/outlook-agent` and `D:/Websites/excel-agent`. Both are separate
projects, not touched by anything here:

- **outlook-agent** — built for **Rufus Ayertey** at Befesa Desalination
  Developments Ghana Ltd (BDDG). Reads Outlook via a local COM bridge
  (Windows + Outlook Classic only — cannot serve a signed-up tenant; a real
  multi-tenant mailbox connection needs Microsoft Graph + OAuth instead).
  This is where `voucher.py`'s tax/FX logic came from and was verified
  against Rufus's real payment voucher and Bank of Ghana FX workbook.
- **excel-agent** — built for **Jessey** at Tema Oil Refinery (TOR). Still
  just a clickable `dashboard.html` mockup; nothing functional was ever
  built there.

Both are real people at real (and different) companies — the first
practical test of whether Buinee's company isolation actually holds
once both of them can register for real.
